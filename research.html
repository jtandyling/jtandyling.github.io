<h1>Research Areas</h1>
<article>

<h2>Historical Morphology</h2>
<p>I primarily study the history of deverbal derivation in Mayan languages. In particular, I study nominalizations and perfect participles, and the way that these categories curiously tend to bleed into one another in Mayan.

<h2>Cuchumatán Language Contact</h2>
<p>A secondary area of my interest is precolonial language contact among Eastern Mayan languages via trade routes in the eastern Cuchumatán mountains. The following conference presentation is on this topic:

	<li>Tandy, James. Feb 14 2020. Innovation and Contact in the K’iche’an Mayan Perfect: The case of <i>-maj.</i> Paper presented at Texas Linguistics Society XIX, University of Texas, Austin. <a href=Tandy_TLS2020_Handout.pdf>Handout</a>
</ul>

<h2>Colonial Poqom</h2>
Poqomchi' and Poqomam (collectively "Poqom"), two closely related K'iche'an languages spoken in the central highlands of Guatemala, are attested in nearly two thousand pages of colonial documents, some dating as far back as the late 1500s. I have a long-term project to transcribe texts from this period and analyze their linguistic features from a historical perspective. A full list of extant Colonial Poqom documents and my transcriptions of individual documents may be found <a href=cpoqom.html>here.</a>

<!--
<p>At some point I hope to host my transcriptions of the Viana-Ximénez-Zúñiga Sermones manuscript, written in the Poqomchi' language in the early 1600s. The original text is part of the <a href=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3916498>Garrett-Gates Mesoamerican Manuscripts collection</a> at Princeton University Library, and a partial typescript done by William Gates in the early 1900s is available in the <a href=https://cdm15999.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15999coll16/id/93049/rec/3>BYU Library Special Collections</a>.
