<h2>Historical Morphology</h2>
<p>I primarily study the history of deverbal derivation in Mayan languages. In particular, I study nominalizations and perfect participles, and the diachronic relationship between these categories in Mayan.

<h2>Language Contact</h2>
<p>My work on historical morphology necessarily makes reference to precolonial language contact among Mayan languages. I have found preliminary evidence for the Sacapulas Corridor, a contact zone that involved several K'iche'an languages in the eastern Cuchumatán mountains of Guatemala. The following conference presentation is on this topic:

</ul>

<h2>Colonial Poqom</h2>
Poqomchi' and Poqomam (collectively "Poqom"), two closely related K'iche'an languages spoken in the central highlands of Guatemala, are attested in nearly two thousand pages of colonial documents, some dating as far back as the late 1500s. I have a long-term project to transcribe texts from this period and analyze their linguistic features from a historical perspective. A full list of extant Colonial Poqom documents and my transcriptions of individual documents may be found on <a href=cpoqom.html>this page.</a>

<!--
<p>At some point I hope to host my transcriptions of the Viana-Ximénez-Zúñiga Sermones manuscript, written in the Poqomchi' language in the early 1600s. The original text is part of the <a href=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3916498>Garrett-Gates Mesoamerican Manuscripts collection</a> at Princeton University Library, and a partial typescript done by William Gates in the early 1900s is available in the <a href=https://cdm15999.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15999coll16/id/93049/rec/3>BYU Library Special Collections</a>.
