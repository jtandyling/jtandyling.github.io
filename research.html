<h2>Historical Morphology</h2>
<p>I primarily study the diachrony of verbal morphology in the Mayan language family. In particular, I focus on constructions that walk the line between derivational and inflectional in Mayan languages: perfect participles, infinitives, and nominalizations of various kinds (gerunds, agent nouns, and patient nouns). These resemble inflectional morphology in that they are often productive and have highly compositional meaning, but also look derivational in that they change the category of the word. I am interested in going deep with the history of these constructions: beyond establishing that similar morphemes across the family are or are not cognate, what were the exact processes that led to the range of functions we see today? Can we show systematic relationships between constructions with similar functions, in order to reconstruct a derivational paradigm for proto-Mayan and its descendants? These are questions that I seek to answer through detailed comparison of the available sources.

<h2>Language Contact</h2>
<p>My work on historical morphology necessarily makes reference to precolonial language contact among Mayan languages. This heavy contact among related languages is both striking and difficult to analyze, in that it is not always clear which features are due to shared inheritance and which are due to contact (for a thorough discussion see <a href="https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027270474" target="_blank">Law 2014</a>). At times, the existing structural similarities among Mayan languages seem to have permitted types of contact that would be typologically rare otherwise. For example, I have argued for at least two instances in which a perfect participle suffix has spread through direct affix borrowing: one (with <i>-b'il</i>) in the very robust Maya Lowlands linguistic area, and the other (<i>-maj</i>) in what I propose to be a previously unidentified contact zone among northern K'iche'an languages (the "Sacapulas Corridor"); the latter has some ethnographic support but needs more analysis on linguistic grounds. For more detail, see the handouts from <a href=pubs.html>my conference presentations.</a>

<h2>Poqom history and philology</h2>
<p>Within the Mayan language family, I have a special focus on Poqomchi' and Poqomam (collectively "Poqom"), two closely related K'iche'an languages spoken in the central highlands of Guatemala. Poqom shows evidence of contact from Ch'olan languages (see Law 2014); in a recent <a href=pubs.html>presentation</a> I discussed the diffusion of the Lowland Mayan phoneme <i>p'</i> into Poqomam and Western Poqomchi'.
<p>Poqomam and Poqomchi' are attested in almost two thousand pages of colonial documents, some dating as far back as the late 1500s. I have a long-term project to transcribe texts from this period and analyze their linguistic features from a historical perspective. A full list of extant Colonial Poqom documents and my transcriptions of individual documents may be found on <a href=cpoqom.html>this page.</a>

<h2>Constructed Languages</h2>
My first exposure to linguistics proper was through the constructed languages of J.R.R. Tolkien, and it is an interest that I have maintained through my formal linguistics training. I see language construction as an art form and essential creative extension of linguistics, a way to expand my knowledge of typology, a perennial reminder that no linguistic feature exists in isolation from the rest of the language or its speakers, and a way to explore linguistic topics that are not otherwise foregrounded in my research. I am also interested in exploring the ways that language construction can be used as a vehicle for teaching linguistics (see for example <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198829874.001.0001/oso-9780198829874" target="_blank">Punske, Sanders, and Fountain 2020</a>). Given my background in morphological theory, historical linguistics, and anthropology, my design goal for my own conlangs is that they be as naturalistic as possible: that they show morphosyntactic complexity reminiscent of natural languages, that they undergo realistic changes over time, and that their fictional setting showcases real-world principles from linguistic anthropology.

<p>At some point I hope to host my transcriptions of the Viana-Ximénez-Zúñiga Sermones manuscript, written in the Poqomchi' language in the early 1600s. The original text is part of the <a href=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3916498>Garrett-Gates Mesoamerican Manuscripts collection</a> at Princeton University Library, and a partial typescript done by William Gates in the early 1900s is available in the <a href=https://cdm15999.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15999coll16/id/93049/rec/3>BYU Library Special Collections</a>.
