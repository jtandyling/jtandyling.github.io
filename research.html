	<h2>Historical Morphology</h2>
	<p>I study the history of verbal morphology in the Mayan language family. In particular, I focus on constructions that walk the line between derivational and inflectional in Mayan languages: perfect participles, infinitives, and nominalizations. These resemble inflectional morphology in that they are often productive and have highly compositional meaning, but also look derivational in that they change the category of the word. Beyond establishing which morphemes across the family are cognate, I treat morphology as a system and explore how that system changed over time. My <a href="Tandy2023_Diachrony_of_the_Perfect_Paradigm_in_Mayan_Languages.pdf" target="_blank">dissertation</a> reconstructs the history of perfect aspect marking from proto-Mayan through modern Mayan languages.</p>
	<!--I am interested in going deep with the history of these constructions: beyond establishing that similar morphemes across the family are or are not cognate, what were the exact processes that led to the range of functions we see today? Can we show systematic relationships between constructions with similar functions, in order to reconstruct a derivational paradigm for proto-Mayan and its descendants? These are questions that I seek to answer through detailed comparison of the available sources. -->

	<h2>Language Contact</h2>
	<p>My work on historical morphology necessarily makes reference to precolonial language contact among Mayan languages. This heavy contact among related languages is both striking and difficult to analyze, in that it is not always clear which features are due to shared inheritance and which are due to contact (for a thorough discussion of this challenge, see <a href="https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027270474" target="_blank">Law 2014</a>). At times, the existing structural similarities among Mayan languages seem to have permitted types of contact that would be typologically rare otherwise. For example, I argue <!--have argued for at least two instances in which a perfect participle suffix has-->that at least two perfect participle suffixes have spread areally through direct affix borrowing: one (<!--with --><i>-b'il</i>) in the robust Maya Lowlands linguistic area, and the other (<i>-maj</i>) in what I propose to be a previously unidentified contact zone among northern K'iche'an and Mamean languages (the "Sacapulas Corridor"). For more detail, see my <a href="pubs.html">publications and conference presentations.</a></p>

	<h2>Poqom history and philology</h2>
	<p>Within the Mayan language family, I have a special focus on Poqomchi' and Poqomam (collectively "Poqom"), two closely related K'iche'an languages spoken in the central highlands of Guatemala. Poqom shows evidence of contact from Ch'olan languages (see Law 2014); in a 2021 <a href="pubs.html">presentation</a> I discussed the diffusion of the Lowland Mayan phoneme <i>p'</i> into Poqomam and Western Poqomchi'.</p>
	<p>Poqomam and Poqomchi' are attested in almost five thousand pages of colonial documents, some dating to the early 1600s. I have a long-term project to transcribe colonial Poqom texts and analyze their linguistic features from a historical perspective. The homepage for the Colonial Poqom Manuscript Project may be found <a href="/ColonialPoqom">here</a>.</p>
	<p>I curate a list of resources for <a href="learnpoqom.html">learning Poqomchi'</a>, for those interested in the modern language.</p>

	<h2 id="Conlangs">Constructed Languages</h2>
	<p>My first exposure to linguistics proper was through the constructed languages of J.R.R. Tolkien, and it is an interest that I have maintained throughout my formal linguistics training. I see language construction as an <a href="https://dedalvs.com/notes/manifesto.php" target="_blank">art form and essential creative extension of linguistics</a>, <!--a way to expand my knowledge of typology, -->a <!--perennial -->reminder that no linguistic feature exists in isolation<!-- from the rest of the language or its speakers-->, and a way to explore linguistic topics that are not otherwise foregrounded in my research. I am also interested in language construction as a vehicle for teaching linguistics (inspired by efforts such as those presented in the excellent volume <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780198829874.001.0001/oso-9780198829874" target="_blank"><i>Language Invention in Linguistics Pedagogy</i></a>, ed. by Punske, Sanders, and Fountain). I strive to make my own conlangs naturalistic, with processes of historical change that make sense for their (fictional) cultural setting.</p>
	<p>I have done conlang commission work in the past. If this is a service you are interested in, please contact me at the email address on my homepage. I follow the Language Creation Society's <a href="https://jobs.conlang.org/pricing" target="_blank">pricing guidelines</a> for projects ranging from naming languages to robust, fully fleshed-out conlangs; also see <a href="https://jobs.conlang.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LCS-Service-Tiers-v3.pdf" target="_blank">this LCS document</a> for a more detailed breakdown of each tier.</p>

	<!--Given my background in morphological theory, historical linguistics, and anthropology, my design goal for my own conlangs is that they be as naturalistic as possible: that they show morphosyntactic complexity reminiscent of natural languages, that they undergo realistic changes over time, and that their fictional setting showcases real-world principles from linguistic anthropology.-->
