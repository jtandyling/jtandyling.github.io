<h2>Field Experience</h2>
<p>For 6 weeks in <b>June and July 2019,</b> I conducted a pilot fieldwork study on the comparative syntax of three K'iche'an languages spoken in Guatemala: Q'eqchi', in San Pedro Carchá, Alta Verapaz; Poqomchi', in Tactic, Alta Verapaz; and Uspanteko, in Uspantán, El Quiché.
<p>In <b>June and July 2016,</b> I attended the 6-week Mayan Language Institute in Nahualá, Guatemala, to study the K'iche' language.
<p>In <b>January 2016,</b> I participated in the Sustainable Development Field School in Partnership with the Ch'orti' Maya, a 2-week study abroad program led by Dr. Brent Metz of The University of Kansas. The program's focus was cultural preservation and environmental sustainability, and how these may or may not align.<!-- The highlight of the two weeks was a Ch'orti' Festival in Jocotán, Guatemala, which our group helped to organize. In addition, we visited two ecolodges to learn about their approaches to sustainability: El Manzano Ecological Park in Dulce Nombre de María, Chalatenango, El Salvador, and Las Cebollas Ecoturismo in Quetzaltepeque, Chiquimula, Guatemala. The rest of our time was spent in Esquipulas, where our side explorations included water treatment facilities, coffee production, and the yearly feast of the Cristo Negro de Esquipulas.-->
