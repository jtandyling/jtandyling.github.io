<h1>Colonial Poqom</h1>
<article>
<p>This page provides resources about Colonial Poqomchi' and Poqomam, collectively "Colonial Poqom."


<h2>List of Archival Materials</h2>
<p>The following document lists all extant manuscripts that I know of in Colonial Poqom (and post-colonial manuscripts through about 1900). This document was based on the finding aids for the Garrett-Gates Mesoamerican Manuscripts at Princeton, the William Gates papers at BYU, the Berendt-Brinton Latin American Collection at University of Pennsylvania, and the Bibliothèque nationale de France (Manuscrits américains and Manuscrits mexicains), as well as online searches of collections at Tulane and Harvard. If you know of Poqom archival documents that are not on this list, please reach out to me; I'd love to know about any others.

<h2>Transcriptions</h2>
<p>Except where otherwise noted, the following are raw transcriptions that I have made of Colonial Poqom documents. These texts and my transcriptions are public domain (with the exception of my brief introductory notes), so feel free to use them at your discretion, though I would appreciate being credited if you copy a portion of my transcriptions for a publication. If you are using one of these documents for research, it may be a good idea to check it against the original. In addition to manuscript transcriptions, I have included links to published linguistic works about Poqom from the same time period.

<p>Note on copyright: While the colonial texts themselves are in the public domain, university archives normally hold the copyright to their own facsimile images of the manuscripts. Annotations may also be copyrightable depending on the extent to which they constitute original work. While my own raw transcriptions presented here have minimal annotation and are therefore public domain, I make no guarantees about the copyright status of material found at external links below; please be aware of any applicable laws or guidelines if you are preparing a publication.

<h3><i>Artes</i> (Grammatical descriptions)</h3>
<p>The following four documents (two manuscripts and two published works) are the only surviving grammars of Poqom from before 1900. Other <i>artes</i> written in the 16th and 17th centuries have since been lost (Vinogradov 2019).
