<h1>Colonial Poqom</h1>
<article>
<p>This page provides resources about Colonial Poqomchi' and Poqomam, collectively "Colonial Poqom."


<h2>List of Archival Materials</h2>
<p>The following document lists all extant manuscripts that I know of in Colonial Poqom (and post-colonial manuscripts through about 1900). This document was based on the finding aids for the Garrett-Gates Mesoamerican Manuscripts at Princeton, the William Gates papers at BYU, the Berendt-Brinton Latin American Collection at University of Pennsylvania, and the Bibliothèque nationale de France (Manuscrits américains and Manuscrits mexicains). If you know of any Poqom archival documents that are not on this list, please reach out to me.

<h2>Transcriptions</h2>
The following are raw transcriptions that I have made of handwritten Colonial Poqom documents. These texts and my transcriptions are public domain, so feel free to use them at your discretion, though I would appreciate being credited if you copy large portions of a transcription. If you are using one of these documents for research, it may be a good idea to check it against the original.
