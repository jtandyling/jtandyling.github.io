<h1>Resources for Learning Poqomchi' (Mayan)</h1>
<article>

<p>There are very few Poqomchi' resources in English, so if you want to learn Poqomchi', it is helpful to know Spanish. It's worth noting that many older resources use the SIL orthography, where velar [k] is represented as 'c' or 'qu' and uvular [q] as 'k'.

<p>Many of the following resources (where noted) can be downloaded for free from the <a href="https://www.almg.org.gt/portfolio-item/c-l-poqomchi" target="_blank">Comunidad Lingüística Poqomchi'</a> page of the website of the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG).

<p>My personal go-to resources are Dobbels' (2003) dictionary and Mó Isém's (2006) thesis. For getting natural input, I mostly rely on the Comunidad Lingüística Poqomchi's YouTube channel, Facebook page, and podcast, as well as the Sociedad Bíblica de Guatemala audio Bible. Note that I originally learned K'iche' which has a very similar structure and a lot more learner-friendly resources, and I am familiar with Mayan languages in general as a linguist, so I had a leg up on the grammar by the time I started learning Poqomchi'. I would probably tell a beginner to start with Ramirez and Ramirez's (1994) manual or Mó Isém's (2010) pedagogical grammar, if you can find either of them, though you'll quickly find you need to supplement with other resources.

<h2>Books about Poqomchi'</h2>

<h3>Pedagogical books</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Boris and Elizabeth Ramirez's (1994) <i>Pokomchí: Manual Trilingüe de Frases y Expresiones</i> is one of the few learner-friendly resources, and has explanations in both English and Spanish. Includes an explanation of the grammar, a dictionary, and a phrasebook that covers several situations (including medical, education, church).
	<li><i>Gramática pedagógica estándar Poqomchi'</i> (2010) by Romelia Mó Isém, published by the ALMG, available through university libraries.
	<li><i>Ilhujb'al Poqomchi'</i> (2016), published by the ALMG, is mostly designed for native speakers who already know the language to learn reading and writing, but I've found it's useful for reading practice. Available from the ALMG website.
	<li><i>Qatijej kiq'orb'al aj-Poqon</i> ("Let's learn the Poqomchi' language") by Alfonso Buc Choc and Marcel Dobbels (1997), available through university libraries.
	<li><i>Peet rukamanjiik ruwií tijinik iib' pan ki'ib' wach q'orik</i> by Armando Najarro (1996) - titled as a pedagogical grammar; I'm not sure of the exact contents.
</ul>

<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Dobbels' (2003) dictionary is by far the most useful and my go-to reference. It's fairly complete, shows all the derived forms of verbs (passive, antipassive, infinitive, perfect participle), and gives example sentences for most words. Poqomchi'-Spanish entries only, so it's helpful to have the searchable PDF, available from the ALMG website.
	<li><i>Vocabulario Poqomchi'</i> (2001) is the official ALMG dictionary, available on their website. Not as thorough as Dobbels, but reliable and includes both Poqomchi'-Spanish and Spanish-Poqomchi' entries.
	<li>Elizabeth R.V. de Sedat's (2001) dictionary is hard to find except through university libraries; I haven't found an electronic copy of it. Thorough, but it's Poqomchi'-Spanish only, and the entries are not completely in alphabetical order, so it's hard to use.
	<li><i>Actualización Lexical Idioma Maya Poqomchi'</i> (2001) presents novel Poqomchi' vocabulary for technology or other cultural concepts that people would otherwise switch to Spanish to express. Available on the ALMG website.
	<li><i>Rub'ihnaal Ruyuq'ul aj Poqomchi' - Toponimias maya poqomchi'</i> is a reference for place-names in the Poqomchi' area.
	<li>If you're interested in reading colonial Poqomchi' texts (for which see my page on <a href="cpoqom.html" target="_blank">Colonial Poqom resources</a>), then Lawrence Feldman's (2004) <i>A Dictionary of Poqom Maya in the Colonial Era</i> helpfully compiles the colonial vocabularies in one place. Unfortunately out of print, but can be borrowed through university libraries, and an abridged PDF is available through <a href="http://www.famsi.org/reports/97022/index.html" target="_blank">FAMSI</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Linguistic grammars</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Romelia Mó Isém's (2006) licenciate thesis from Universidad Rafael Landívar, <i>Fonología y Morfología del Poqomchi' Occidental</i>, is the standard reference that covers the phonology and morphology. PDF can be found through university libraries.
	<li>Mó Isém's (2007) book <i>Derivación de palabras en Poqomchi'</i>, published by OKMA, covers derivational morphology (ways to make words from other words). Most of this information is also in her thesis, but it's a helpful reference since it's all in one place.
	<li>Malchic Nicolás et al. (2000) <i>Variación dialectal en Poqom</i> is a thorough study of dialectal variation in Poqomchi' and Poqomam.
	<li>The ALMG's <i>Gramática Normativa Poqomchi'</i> (2012) is a normative grammar - that is, more about standardizing the language and how it is written, rather than describing the way people speak - but is still helpfully organized. Available from the ALMG website.
	<li>Linda Brown's (1979) doctoral thesis <i>Word Formation in Pocomchi (Mayan)</i> is one that I use less often but occasionally mentions data not found in other sources.
	<li>Lindsay Weichel's (2006) master's thesis <i>The Grammatical Structure of Western Pokomchi'</i> discusses Poqomchi' grammar from the perspective of Case Grammar Theory, a particular linguistic framework. She has more discussion of semantics (meaning) than other sources.
	<li>Marvin K. Mayers and Igor Vinogradov have written academic articles about more specific aspects of the Poqomchi' language and its history.
</ul>
