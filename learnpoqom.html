<h1>Resources for Learning Poqomchi'</h1>
<article>

<p>There are very few Poqomchi' resources in English, so if you want to learn Poqomchi', it is helpful to know Spanish. It's also worth noting that most resources published before 1990 use the SIL orthography, where the velar [k] and uvular [q] are represented as 'c'/'qu' and 'k' respectively.

<p>Many of the following resources (noted below) can be downloaded for free from the <a href="https://www.almg.org.gt/portfolio-item/c-l-poqomchi" target="_blank">Comunidad Lingüística Poqomchi'</a> page of the website of the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala (ALMG).

<p>My personal go-to resources are Dobbels' 2003 dictionary and Mó Isém's 2006 thesis. For getting natural input, I mostly rely on the Comunidad Lingüística Poqomchi's YouTube channel, Facebook page, and podcast, as well as the Sociedad Bíblica de Guatemala audio Bible.

<h2>Books to Learn</h2>

<h3>Pedagogical books</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Boris and Elizabeth Ramirez's (1994) <i>Pokomchí: Manual Trilingüe de Frases y Expresiones</i> is one of the few learner-friendly resources, and has explanations in both English and Spanish. Includes an explanation of the grammar, a dictionary, and a phrasebook that covers several situations (including medical, education, church).
	<li><i>Ilhujb'al Poqomchi'</i> (2016), published by the ALMG, is mostly designed for native speakers who already know the language to learn reading and writing, but I've found it's useful for reading practice. Available from the ALMG website.
</ul>

<h3>Dictionaries</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Dobbels' (2003) dictionary is by far the most useful and my go-to reference. It's fairly complete, shows all the derived forms of verbs (passive, antipassive, infinitive, perfect participle), and gives example sentences for most words. Poqomchi'-Spanish entries only, so it's helpful to have the searchable PDF, available from the ALMG website.
	<li><i>Vocabulario Poqomchi'</i> (2001) is the official ALMG dictionary, available on their website. Not as thorough as Dobbels, but reliable and includes both Poqomchi'-Spanish and Spanish-Poqomchi' entries.
	<li>Elizabeth R.V. de Sedat's (2001) dictionary is hard to find except through university libraries; I haven't found an electronic copy of it. Thorough, but it's Poqomchi'-Spanish only, and the entries are not completely in alphabetical order, so it's hard to use.
	<li><i>Actualización Lexical Idioma Maya Poqomchi'</i> (2001) presents novel Poqomchi' vocabulary for technology or other cultural concepts that people would otherwise switch to Spanish to express. Available on the ALMG website.
	<li>If you're interested in reading colonial Poqomchi' texts (for which see my page on <a href="cpoqom.html" target="_blank">Colonial Poqom resources</a>), then Lawrence Feldman's (2004) <i>A Dictionary of Poqom Maya in the Colonial Era</i> helpfully compiles the colonial vocabularies in one place. Unfortunately out of print, but can be borrowed through university libraries, and an abridged PDF is available through <a href="http://www.famsi.org/reports/97022/index.html" target="_blank">FAMSI</a>.
</ul>

<h3>Linguistic grammars</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Romelia Mó Isém's (2006) licenciate thesis from Universidad Rafael Landívar, <i>Fonología y Morfología del Poqomchi' Occidental</i>, is the standard reference that covers the phonology and morphology. PDF can be found through university libraries.
	<li>Mó Isém's (2007) book <i>Derivación de palabras en Poqomchi'</i>, published by OKMA, covers derivational morphology (ways to make words from other words). Most of this information is also in her thesis, but it's a helpful reference since it's all in one place.
	<li>The ALMG's <i>Gramática Normativa Poqomchi'</i> (2012) is a normative grammar - that is, more about standardizing the language and how it is written, rather than describing the way people speak, but is still helpfully organized. Available from the ALMG website.
	<li>Linda Brown's (1979) doctoral thesis <i>Word Formation in Pocomchi (Mayan)</i> is one that I use less often but occasionally mentions data not found in other sources.
	<li>Lindsay Weichel's (2006) master's thesis <i>The Grammatical Structure of Western Pokomchi'</i> discusses Poqomchi' grammar from the perspective of Case Grammar Theory, a particular linguistic framework. She has more discussion of semantics (meaning) than other sources.

<h2>Videos</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The YouTube channel of the ALMG Comunidad Lingüística Poqomchi' (currently called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@canal5tvmayapoqomchi-almg-350" target="_blank">Canal 5 TV Maya Poqomchi' -ALMG-</a>) is the most active producer of Poqomchi' content. They have a mix of short language learning videos, informational notices, and occasional long-form documentaries. They have some older videos on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@comunidadlinguisticapoqomc5254" target="_blank">second channel.</a>
	<li>The Comunidad Lingüística Poqomchi' posts videos on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100068505282930" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>. Some overlap with the YouTube channel, but they also host live streams of special events.
	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@franciscoicaljom" target="_blank">Francisco ICAL JOM</a> is a native Poqomchi' speaker from Belejú who makes videos about Mayan culture and immigration. He has several videos in Poqomchi', including a series where actors roleplay everyday conversations (with and without subtitles).

	<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfT8mZy-JUs" target="_blank">The Prodigal Son</a>, entirely in Poqomchi', filmed in and around San Cristóbal Verapaz. About 40 minutes. I watch this every so often to test my progress.

	<li>I have compiled as many videos as I can find in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvA-edWwbX0QY5zxw5S3afc5MURnrmLAn" target="_blank">YouTube playlist</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Podcast</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The Comunidad Lingüística Poqomchi' publishes a podcast of the same name, available on Spotify. Most of the episodes are about the importance of using and teaching the language, with a few episodes about place-names and dialectal variation. They also have a few short fables in Poqomchi'.
