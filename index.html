<p>This is my website. Still under construction. If you are looking for my CV, click <a href=JamesTandyCV_web.pdf>here</a>.</p>
<p>I am a linguist at The University of Texas at Austin who studies Mayan linguistics, especially historical morphology, language contact, and colonial texts. I have direct field experience with languages of the K'iche'an branch, particularly K'iche' and Poqomchi', and to a lesser extent Q'eqchi' and Uspanteko.</p>
<p>At some point I hope to host my transcriptions of the Viana-Ximénez-Zúñiga Sermones manuscript, written in the Poqomchi' language in the early 1600s. The original text is part of the <a href=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3916498>Garrett-Gates Mesoamerican Manuscripts collection</a> at Princeton University Library, and a partial typescript done by William Gates in the early 1900s is available in the <a href=https://cdm15999.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15999coll16/id/93049/rec/3>BYU Library Special Collections</a>.
