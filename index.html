<!-- <h2>Research Interests</h2> -->
<p>I am a linguist at The University of Texas at Austin who studies Mayan languages, especially historical morphology, language contact, and colonial texts. My research is primarily archival, but I have direct field experience with languages of the K'iche'an branch, particularly K'iche' and Poqomchi', and to a lesser extent Q'eqchi' and Uspanteko.</p>

<p>Watch my recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzbT-oQd0VM" target="_blank">interview with Colin Gorrie</a> about Mayan languages!</p>

<!--
<h3>Historical Morphology</h3>
<p>I primarily study the history of deverbal derivation in Mayan languages. In particular, I study nominalizations and perfect participles, and the way that these categories curiously tend to bleed into one another in Mayan.

<h3>K'iche'an Reconstruction</h3>

<h3>Cuchumatán Language Contact</h3>
<p>A secondary area of my interest is precolonial language contact among Eastern Mayan languages via trade routes in the eastern Cuchumatán mountains. The following conference presentation is on this topic:

</ul>

<!-- If I even get a few sections transcribed, I should add them here so there's actually something substantial to say about my colonial work.
<h3>Colonial Poqom</h3>
<p>At some point I hope to host my transcriptions of the Viana-Ximénez-Zúñiga Sermones manuscript, written in the Poqomchi' language in the early 1600s. The original text is part of the <a href=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/3916498>Garrett-Gates Mesoamerican Manuscripts collection</a> at Princeton University Library, and a partial typescript done by William Gates in the early 1900s is available in the <a href=https://cdm15999.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15999coll16/id/93049/rec/3>BYU Library Special Collections</a>.

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>In Fall 2017, I completed my Bachelor's of Arts in Linguistics and Anthropology with a minor in Latin American Studies at the University of Kansas in Lawrence.
<p>I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Linguistics at The University of Texas at Austin.

<h2>Field Experience</h2>
<p>For 6 weeks in June and July 2019, I conducted a pilot fieldwork study on the comparative syntax of three K'iche'an languages spoken in Guatemala: Q'eqchi', in San Pedro Carchá, Alta Verapaz; Poqomchi', in Tactic, Alta Verapaz; and Uspanteko, in Uspantán, El Quiché.
<p>In June and July 2016, I attended the 6-week Mayan Language Institute in Nahualá, Guatemala, to study the K'iche' language.
<p>In January 2016, I participated in the Sustainable Development Field School in Partnership with the Ch'orti' Maya, a 2-week study abroad program led by Dr. Brent Metz of The University of Kansas. The program's focus was cultural preservation and environmental sustainability, and how these do or do not align. The highlight of the two weeks was a Ch'orti' Festival in Jocotán, Guatemala, which our group helped to organize. In addition, we visited two ecolodges to learn about their approaches to sustainability: El Manzano Ecological Park in Dulce Nombre de María, Chalatenango, El Salvador, and Las Cebollas Ecoturismo in Quetzaltepeque, Chiquimula, Guatemala. The rest of our time was spent in Esquipulas, where our side explorations included water treatment facilities, coffee production, and the yearly feast of the Cristo Negro de Esquipulas.
