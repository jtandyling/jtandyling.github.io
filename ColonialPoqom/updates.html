		<h3>New Berendt transcriptions</h3>
		<p><i><time>February 9, 2026</time> by James Tandy</i></p>
		<p>A few previously completed transcriptions that were sitting in the pipeline have been reformatted for the website and are now available on the Manuscripts page. Listed by CPMP ID, these include:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><b>bblc0062</b>: <i>Doctrina christiana en pocomchi</i> (Berendt partial transcription of bblc0068)</li>
			<li><b>bblc0064</b>: <i>Platica en lengua pocomchi</i> (Berendt transcription of first half of bblc0065)</li>
			<li><b>bblc0066</b>: <i>Doctrina christiana en pocomchí</i> (Berendt transcription of unknown document)</li>
			<li><b>bblc0089</b> and <b>bblc0090</b>: Two Poqomam wordlists, compiled into a single Excel file "Two vocabularies of Poqomam"</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>I have also included references to Acuña's (1991) and Feldman's (2004) out-of-print compilations of the colonial <i>vocabularios</i>.</p>

		<h3>CPMP Website Launch</h3>
		<p><i><time>January 19, 2026</time> by James Tandy</i></p>
		<p>I restructured my website so that the Colonial Poqom Manuscript Project now has its own self-contained directory. I also made some improvements to the site's visual design. The original "Colonial Poqom resources" page has become the <a href="manuscripts.html">Manuscripts</a> page on this site. Like before, the Manuscripts page includes links to the Excel database for the project and all available transcriptions.</p>
		
		<p>New transcriptions have been uploaded to the Manuscripts page: Garrett-Gates #234, <i>Sermonario</i>, parts B and D (excerpt). This is the longest manuscript in the collection, and now fully one-third of it is available in raw text format.</p>
		
		<p>More updates are planned for the near future to improve organization and ease of access. Some other new transcriptions are also in the pipeline - stay tuned!</p>
