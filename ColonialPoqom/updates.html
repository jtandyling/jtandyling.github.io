		<h3>CPMP Website Launch</h3>
		<p><i><time>January 19, 2026</time> by James Tandy</i></p>
		<p>I restructured my website so that the Colonial Poqom Manuscript Project now has its own self-contained directory. I also made some improvements to the site's visual design. The original "Colonial Poqom resources" page has become the <a href="manuscripts.html">Manuscripts</a> page on this site. Like before, the Manuscripts page includes links to the Excel database for the project and all available transcriptions.</p>
		
		<p>New transcriptions have been uploaded to the Manuscripts page: Garrett-Gates #234, <i>Sermonario</i>, parts B and D (excerpt). This is the longest manuscript in the collection, and now fully one-third of it is available in raw text format.</p>
		
		<p>More updates are planned for the near future to improve organization and ease of access. Some other new transcriptions are also in the pipeline - stay tuned!</p>
