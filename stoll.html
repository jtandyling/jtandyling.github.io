<h1>Stoll 1888, Die Maya-Sprache der Pokom-Gruppe</h1>
<article>
<p>This page contains a partial English translation of Otto Stoll's (1888) grammar of Poqom, originally written in German. Stoll's work is excellent; in my opinion, the quality of his description compares favorably to many grammars of Mayan languages from the mid-20th century. It is therefore valuable not just for identifying historical changes over the last 130 years (there are surprisingly few), but as a description in its own right. <! Thus, both for my own study and for the benefit of other students of Poqom, I felt that it would be worthwhile to have the whole book in English.>
<p>This translation was done primarily through Google Translate, with manual edits by me based on my understanding of the context and my limited knowledge of German. Because the purpose at this point is simply to have a text readable by English speakers, the translation is not polished and would benefit from revision by a more proficient speaker of German. Any mistakes are my own.
<p>Copyright: Stoll's original <! give a link> is in the public domain. This translation is copyrighted by me. Feel free to use this as an aid to your own study, but because this is a work in progress and still needs heavy revision, please do not reproduce the text of the translation. I strongly recommend consulting the original if you plan to cite Stoll in a publication.
